Considered: 1) Mood DJ, 2) Campus Jam Finder, 3) FinTrack (chosen).
Chose FinTrack for recruiter relevance (fintech CRUD + analytics). Risks: useful charts, time-series aggregation. Next: seed categories and transactions.

wireframe: v1 covers login, dashboard with KPIs/charts, add-transaction core screen, empty/error state. Next: CSV export and budget alerts.

Branching Strategy - GitHub Flow with short-lived branches (wireframes-v1, feature/models, feature/charts). PRs into main.

Branch Usage Reflections - created wireframes-v1, added wireframes, opened PR, merged with descriptive message.

Django Setup - startproject: fintrack; startapp: tracker. Short, descriptive names.

Virtual Environment Choice - conda myenv-django in PyCharm for isolation and reproducibility.
